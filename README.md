# odin-recipes
This project involes creating a simple wepbage that shows recipes for dishes.

The index.html file contains links to the different recipes on seperate html documents.

Each html document contains a title of the dish name, an image of it, a description, and finally a list of its ingredients within a html list element.

They also include a link back to the homepage for ease of access.
